Hi! I'm a Data Scientist and an Applied ML Researcher. As much as I love building unique, state-of-the-art, deep learning solutions, I also love the data science behind experimentation and visualization.

Experienced in all aspects of the Machine Learning workflow from feature engineering to model explainability, I'm currently a Machine Learning - Applied Research Intern at ICICI Bank working on credit underwriting models and fraud detection. I'm also an MSc. in Applied Computing candidate specializing in Data Science.
