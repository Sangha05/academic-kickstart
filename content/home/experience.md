  * Sole member of the Data Science and Analytics Group at ICICI Bank Canada with research approved and partly funded by Mitacs Accelerate. Trusted with designing and building a ‘Zero Credit Touch’ (ZCT) system with projected impact on 20 million+ customers.
  * Improved credit underwriting gini coefficient (2*AUC - 1) by 12% and decile wise gini by 6% by developing an ensemble model consisting of XGBoost, LightGBM and a neural network (with LSTMs and 1D Convolutions).
  * Cut down data dimensionality by 55% from 400 to 185 features using Shapley model explanations and manifold learning techniques like Locally Linear Embeddings and t-SNE. 
  * Optimized AUC using synthetic data generation using a combination of SMOTE and CTGAN (Conditional GAN for Tabular Data) after researching best-suited techniques for handling imbalanced datasets.
  * Used Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) for customer segmentation to identify clusters where the model does not perform well, that translated to an increase in model’s decile wise gini by 11% when the poor performing cluster is removed.
